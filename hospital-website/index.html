                precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority.<br><br>
                <b>#</b> To prevent the spread of COVID-19:<br>
                <b>1. </b>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.<br>
                <b>2. </b>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br>
                <b>3. </b>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.<br>
                <b>4. </b>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>
                <b>5. </b>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br>

                Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health
